# Huffman-encoding
Implemented huffman encoding using heap datastructure.

October 2013

To run the code -   
python test_huffman.py

The huffman code compresses a given file and finally uncompresses it.
The test code runs the huffman code against the three test cases text1, text2, and text3; checks if the compression is done correctly.
